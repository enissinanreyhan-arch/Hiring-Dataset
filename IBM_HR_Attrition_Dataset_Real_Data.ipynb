      "The machine learning model predicts a high attrition risk (Attrition=1) for the original employee profile based on several key factors. Notably, the employee has a relatively low **JobInvolvement** score of 1, which indicates minimal engagement with their work. Additionally, the **EnvironmentSatisfaction** score is also low at 2, suggesting dissatisfaction with the work environment. Furthermore, the employee has been in their current role for 7 years without a promotion, as indicated by the **YearsSinceLastPromotion** score of 1, which may contribute to feelings of stagnation and a desire to seek opportunities elsewhere. The combination of these factors likely signals to the model that the employee is at a higher risk of leaving the organization.\n",

      "### Counterfactual Explanations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Counterfactual 1: OverTime=0, PercentSalaryHike=20**\n",
      "   - **Change**: The employee's **OverTime** status changes from 1 (indicating they work overtime) to 0, and the **PercentSalaryHike** increases from 13 to 20.\n",
      "   - **Impact**: Reducing overtime may improve work-life balance, potentially increasing job satisfaction and reducing attrition risk. A higher salary increase could enhance the employee's financial satisfaction and perceived value within the company, further decreasing the likelihood of leaving.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Counterfactual 2: JobLevel=2**\n",
      "   - **Change**: The **JobLevel** increases from 1 to 2.\n",
      "   - **Impact**: A higher job level typically correlates with greater responsibility, recognition, and potential for career advancement. This change may enhance the employee's engagement and satisfaction with their role, thereby reducing the risk of attrition.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Counterfactual 3: EnvironmentSatisfaction=4**\n",
      "   - **Change**: The **EnvironmentSatisfaction** score increases from 2 to 4.\n",
      "   - **Impact**: An improved environment satisfaction score suggests a more positive work atmosphere, which can significantly influence an employee's decision to stay with the organization. Higher satisfaction in the work environment may lead to increased loyalty and reduced attrition risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Counterfactual 4: JobSatisfaction=2, OverTime=0**\n",
      "   - **Change**: The **JobSatisfaction** decreases from 4 to 2, while **OverTime** changes from 1 to 0.\n",
      "   - **Impact**: Although the decrease in job satisfaction appears counterintuitive, the reduction in overtime may still improve overall work-life balance, which can mitigate the negative impact of lower job satisfaction. This balance may lead to a more favorable view of the job, thus lowering attrition risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the model's prediction of high attrition risk for the original employee is influenced by low job involvement, low environment satisfaction, and a lack of recent promotions.

    "CONCLUSION\n",
    "\n",
    "The current use case, where the outcome of the algorithm is used as an input for automatic salary increase, falls under the scope of the article 22 and right to explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this is a classification algorithm, the deicision boundary is subject to change, in line with the algorithm's metrics like F1, recall, AUC, Precision and Accuracy. It is possible to provide counterfactual example for this case. There may be the case where probability generated by the algorithm is used as a variable for the calculation of the wage increase. In this case, no decision boundary is determined, thus, it is not possible to generate a counterfactual example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, in this use case, the counterfactual examples are not meaningful for data subject. Although it gives certain grounds to contest to decision (the variables are discriminative or are not in employee's discretion etc.), it is possible to exclude the variables, which have major effect on the algorithm's decision, in the process of creating counterfactual examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, counterfactual explanations are meaningful for company administration and may guide them on how to avoid their employees' exit from the company. Explanations created by LLM for these counterfactual examples are explanatory for the company administration, as well. As these counterfactual examples are instance based, it may provide information for specific employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this use case is an important example for algorithms with normative effect. So it must be subject to right to explanation and fall under the scope of GDPR. As counterfactual examples are not satisfactory, other techniques must be applied for data owner, to exercise his/her right to explanation.\n"
